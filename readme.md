Uses BeautifulSoup to get the html of the page and I inspected the page and found that the titles were in the articles tag,
so I used a loop on it and further found the names in their respective tags
For getting csv file, I used Pandas dataframe and appended the data into it and used to_csv inbuilt function of pandas to export the data as csv file
